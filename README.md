# Music Synth Project
Developed with C++14 and JUCE to develop a synthesizer that can play a sine, saw, or square wave. 
When started, an ADSR envelope that can be modified to shape the sound's velocity shape will be displayed. As well, a wave selector box that can change what wave type can be played will be present.

## Usage

- To be used within a DAW as a simple monosynth for production, or as an instrument for performance as a standalone plugin
- Can be played as an instrument using a MIDI keyboard

## Dependencies

- C++14
- JUCE version 6.0.5
